# DrinkGenius Bot

Welcome to DrinkGenius Bot, your personal cocktail expert on Telegram! This bot is designed to provide you with a wide range of cocktail recommendations, recipes, and ingredients right at your fingertips. Whether you're a seasoned mixologist or a beginner looking to impress your friends, DrinkGenius Bot has got you covered.

## How It Works

DrinkGenius Bot utilizes the pyTelegramBotAPI to interact with users on Telegram. Before starting the bot you must run script called `website_scraper.py` to scrape data from the popular website [inshaker.com](https://us.inshaker.com). This data includes essential attributes such as images, names, ingredients, recipes, and various categories like degree, taste, base, and category.

The main functionality is handled by the `cocktail_bot.py` file, which acts as the brain of the bot. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. **Cocktail Recommendations**: Get personalized cocktail recommendations based on your preferences.
2. **Recipe and Ingredients**: Access detailed recipes and ingredient lists for each cocktail.
3. **Search Functionality**: Search for cocktails by categories, such as degree, taste, base, and category.


## To-Do List:

- **Improve Readability**: Enhance the codebase to make it more readable and maintainable.
- **Recommendation System**: Implement a simple recommendation system based on preferred ingredients.
- **Ratings**: Add functionality for users to rate cocktails and provide feedback.
- **Additional Functionality**: Expand features like advanced search options and cocktail history.
